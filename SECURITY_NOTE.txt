SECURITY REMINDER: Token Management
====================================

The release scripts (builder.py, scripts/release.py, tools/release_now.sh) 
use tokens for GitHub authentication. Best practices:

✅ GOOD:
- Use environment variable: GITHUB_TOKEN or GH_PAT
- Scripts clean up the token from remote URL after push
- Never commit tokens to the repository
- Use $GITHUB_TOKEN in commands (shell expands it securely)

⚠️ AVOID:
- Hardcoding tokens in scripts or commands
- Sharing tokens in messages or logs
- Leaving tokens in git remote URLs permanently

The scripts already handle cleanup, but always verify your token 
is stored in environment variables, not in code or shell history.
